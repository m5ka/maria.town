waso pinja is my interpretation of traditional magpie (or other black bird) divination rhymes into [toki pona]({% link _pages/toki-pona.md %}).

> waso pinja wan li ken·<br>
> tu li ike· san li len·<br>
> neja lili· luka pali·<br>
> waso kulu: pona ali·

roughly translated, you could read it as

> one black bird is a possibility,<br>
> two are a sadness, three are a secret,<br>
> four something small, five something made<br>
> and six birds for happiness in every way
