> Hi, I found your site via the Yesterweb discord when trying to search for how to set up a static site generator for my own neocities site. Your site is #goals, and I think your layout is gorgeous. You've shared so much interesting stuff here, and I'll definitely pour over it once I finish wrapping my non-technical brain around Jekyll. Looking forward to your "jekyll for the smallnet" idea coming to fruition eventually!<br>

> Love how warm, cozy, and thoughtfully-designed your webpage is. Feels like visiting a distant and peaceful planet filled with lush plains and night-blooming flowers. And the inclusion of Leah from Stardew Valley made me smile (she's my favorite!)<br>
