there are tons of cool people who are also making their own spaces online. here's my little collection of cool people!

## lydia
massive shout-out to 🎷[lydia portrait](https://lyd.city/) who is an epic person and music producer and website maker. her site is so much fun to explore. (even tho i can't find the wizard's key 😢)

## friends

* 🍙[lija](https://lija.neocities.org/)· sick music and cool site design
* 🐒[sami](https://yint.neocities.org/)· funee monkee gif
* 💻️[joop](http://joop.kiefte.eu/)· neato modern development coolness

## cool sites
these are cool sites made by cool people i've seen around the smallnet. i don't necessarily know the people who made them but their sites made me say "wowsers trousers!" and that's pretty high praise as trouser-related interjections go.
