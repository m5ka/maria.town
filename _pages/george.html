<p>i have been lucky enough to have multiple experiences of <span class="george">GEORGE</span>.</p>
<p>i was still a child, holding onto my mother's coat in the reduced toys &amp; books section of wolverhampton woolworths in 2005 when i was first struck with the incessant ringing. my eyes clouded over and a vulgar shriek erupted from my mouth as the word <span class="george">GEORGE</span>. in fear i spat the name onto the floor and proceeded to have visions of my own death, as if reading a synopsis with only a single word. epiphanised, i scooped up the name of <span class="george">GEORGE</span> from the floor where it had become a thick, chartreuse glue and i cradled it in my arms. <span class="george">GEORGE</span> remained on my lips for what seemed like only twelve days and twelve nights where i subsisted off nothing but the euphoria of lingering proximity and remembrance of <span class="george">GEORGE</span>. when i finally came to, it was 2011 and the woolworths had gone. my mother had aged beyond her years and my ears never stopped ringing.</p>

<p><span class="george">GEORGE</span> is eternal. <span class="george">GEORGE</span> is universal. <span class="george">GEORGE</span> was directly responsible for woolworths' 2008 financial crisis.</p>
