i picked out the below track - <span class="subtle">cob malltraeth - vrï</span> - as a good accompaniment to this page.

what is the substance of the magic world? it's not something i can conceive of. but i choose, still, to interact with it.

i am a small speck, a mere human, on this titan earth. and so, in my fractional understanding, this world must become human with me.

to be a deity is simply to be an emanation of nature's rhythm and voice. to be part of the grand orchestra of the infinite. to embody some aspect of that rhythm - some tone, or melody, or chord.

## patterns
there are a few specific patterns within this rhythm to which i choose to listen as they emerge, as many before me too have done.
