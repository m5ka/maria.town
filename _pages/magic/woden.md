i picked out the below track - <span class="subtle">pagan poetry - bj√∂rk</span> - as a good accompaniment to this page.

**w√≥den** (‚Üê proto-germanic *w≈çdanaz ‚Üê *w≈çdaz "frenzied, spirited") is a deity, a pattern of nature, who embodies the aspects of poetry, wisdom, magic, healing, transformations and altered states.

other names which i associate with her are **minerva** (‚Üê proto-indo-european *m√©n-es-ueh‚ÇÇ ‚Üê *men- "mind") and **sulis**.

i also make reference to them with epithets **the healer**, **the wise** and **the witch**.

## magic
w√≥den is a patron of magic, especially that of transformation. i often invoke her in my own magical practices.

## gender and duality
i see w√≥den as encompassing a duality in gender. it could be that she has both masculine and feminine energy at one time - being, in some way, a full unity of both conditions. alternatively, she may well be a biune - two deities existing as one: a masculine and a feminine.

eitherway, i interact with w√≥den on fairly fluid terms gender-wise. i even consider her to be patron of those of us who have journied along the boundaries and veils between gender and other such distinctions. i find her to especially bless magic of this field.

## altered states
there are many altered states as might be included under minerva's patronage

* hypnagogia (the transient veil between wakefulness and sleep)
* violence, rage and emotional frenzy
* psychoactive and hallucinogenic states
* hypnosis, trance and deep meditation
* artistic trance (trance induced by consumption of or participation in art)

any one of them may be a port of access to w√≥den and his myriad offerings.
