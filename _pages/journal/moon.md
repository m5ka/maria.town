## 2022-08-07 10:58· bloom 🌸 {#article:2022-08-07-bloom}
after one of the most stressful periods i've felt this year, i've been struck with a sudden sense of realignment. now piecing myself together again, it seems i've reformed in some ways stronger than before and finally admitted to myself after some terrible experiences with controlling people in my life years ago that i may feel and believe as i truly do and not as i am wished to.

to myself and to those who share my life i have admitted my path and my feelings and my thoughts and my beliefs, those which fall into the realms of heathenism and of magic and of nature herself.

what peace that comes from the blossoming of flowers after a flash-frozen winter.

## 2022-07-22 17:50· nostalgia 🤩 {#article:2022-07-22-nostalgia}

i found [this wordpress site](https://wooliesbuildings.wordpress.com/) today which catalogues the history of all the uk woolworths stores before the big 2008 woolworths financial disaster where they all closed.

aside from just being a fun kind of thing to find as a nerd, it gave me big nostalgia to see pictures of the old woolworths store that i knew and recognised. pretty neat.

other than that i've still been tired but i think better for knowing that i might just be a little bit ill. i feel like once you know <em>why</em> you feel a way, sometimes it takes a bit of that weight off your shoulders y'know? like you're allowed to feel a little stinky then.

i added a [help]({% link _pages/help.md %}) page to my site today which was neat and a fun exercise. i'm excited to work on more and more content even though it feels like i already have so many pages at this point haha.

## 2022-07-20 13:09· stretched 😪 {#article:2022-07-20-stretched}

after the heat and illness i think i'm still having a little bit of trouble getting back into a good rhythm with work, even with a gentle push from meds. i wonder sometimes if being at this point is something cyclical as it's very familiar but spaced out. it's low, despairing and feels like it will never end but it always seems to, as unbelievable as that is to me right now.
    
on top of it, we seem to have flies out of nowhere in the flat which is a pain. i'll need to figure out some ways to get rid of them once i've put enough energy into work.
    
the world is still turning and morphing outside, still beautiful. i love the world, i just sometimes wish i could live in it and not outside it. tomorrow will be better.

## 2022-07-18 18:25· hot, hot, hot 🌶️ {#article:2022-07-18-hot}

hey, moon. it's been a while. we're currently in the middle of our big heatwave here and it's definitely feeling pretty hot. but i think i'm more or less managing to keep cool, it's just making me so tired! i literally just woke up from an accidental nap.

after seeing it a lot on [status.cafe](https://status.cafe) i've been getting the desire to learn japanese again after a very long time (i've not been actively learning it since i was probably about 15!) so i'm wondering whether to give into that desire or not.

if i do give in and get back into it, maybe i'll even start a bigger post in my sun journal about it. i've been meaning to do a more zoomed in look at my language learning process on this site one day, so who knows...

## 2022-07-15 20:30· rest and digest 🔮 {#article:2022-07-15-rest-digest}

it's been a much lower day today, with not much doing. and that never feels great. but i at least managed to get my thoughts about the [status.cafe](https://status.cafe) emoji widget down on the forum over there. so i'll count that as something.

generally though feeling a bit low. maybe waning again after such a powerful moon. maybe that's just what's to be woven in my wyrd right now. who knows. all i know is i'm going to watch a ton of comfort tv (natgeo documentaries)

## 2022-07-14 10:44· owl house 🦉 {#article:2022-07-14-owl-house}

me and my partner finally reached the end of the second season of [the owl house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Owl_House) and wow. it was amazing as expected but it did not feel like an ending, there are more questions now than i had at the start? absolutely **need** season three to come out.

other than that though, yesterday was a nice day and i hope today is the same. i feel like i'm getting energy back again after being ill for so long.

## 2022-07-13· hello, moon 🌙 {#article:2022-07-13-hello-moon}

so i'd been churning inside fretting about what direction to take my journal in and i never thought to just have two different journals. now here i am.

i named this sweeter, more intimate journal the <strong>moon journal</strong> after my most treasured celestial body.

i like to think that the moon hears every secret whisper and every obscure thought. she is comfort and familiarity, a refuge from the searing dominance of the sun.

so let's see how this little journal goes. my shrine to her, our moon, with my flittering thoughts as quaint offerings.
