pierogi is too interesting a topic to _not_ get its own page.

i tend to make my pierogi with a warm, spicy [kasza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasha) and mushroom filling and serve it with onions fried in smoked paprika.

unfortunately they are such a **hassle**!!!! and take so much time that i don't make them very often at all. i could eat them forever though mmm...
