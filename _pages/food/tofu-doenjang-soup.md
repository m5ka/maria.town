i don't make this soup super often because i don't often have [doenjang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang) (fermented soybean paste) in but when i do it's **so** good and honestly quite quick and easy to make.

i learned this recipe from [maangchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFN1jpZbCuA) who i would really recommend!
