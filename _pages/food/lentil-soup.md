lentil soup is a warming, classic favourite of mine. it feels especially good in autumn or winter, or when i'm ill.

i usually make it by simmering red split lentils in salted water, then once they're cooked mixing it with fried spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric and black pepper. this is (i think) a fairly typical indian [dal tadka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal#Preparation) preparation. sometimes i'll add a few simple veg to the spice mix, like peas or chickpeas.
