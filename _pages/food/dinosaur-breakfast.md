once my partner wasn't feeling so great when we woke up so i offered to make her a comfort breakfast. when i asked what she wanted, she said "dinosaur breakfast" excitedly. it was too sweet a request for me to refuse. and thus, dinosaur breakfast was born.

in spite of a very questionable dinosaurian resemblance, it did its job of cheering my partner up very well. ðŸ¥°
