i make languages (known as [conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)) and often little counterpart lands for them to live in

## a priori
* <i class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">🍵</i>[zadmáh]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah.md %}) ─ derivationally expressive lang spoken by a hierarchical, taboo-based culture

## a posteriori
* <i class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">🍑</i>[caliprian]({% link _pages/conlangs/caliprian.md %}) ─ ie subfamily on mediterranean archipelago
* <i class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">🫒</i>[vedian]({% link _pages/conlangs/vedian.md %}) ─ ie language on small island in caspian sea
* <i class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">⛵️</i>[vislandic]({% link _pages/conlangs/vislandic.md %}) ─ tiny ie language of north-west europe

## graveyard
in probably typical conlanger fashion, behind the above neat little listing stands a colossal graveyard of discarded conlangs. these are a few of the ex-langs that stick in my mind still

* riyan ─ one of my oldest langs, aka psuedo-celtic mess
* áucist ─ my first attempt at a polysynthetic lang
* nkim coʻ ─ minimalist village language
