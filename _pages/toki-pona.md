[toki pona](https://tokipona.org/) is a minimalist language made by jan Sonja in 2001.
in theory there are only a base of 120 to 140 words but i'm a big fan of extending toki pona to the needs of whoever i'm communicating with, and so myself and others tend to use a wider base set of words.

nimi mi kepeken toki pona li jan Kiwa. sitelen pona ni li kule insa wawa ale.

## my favourite non-standard words
* **ete** ─ "beyond, exceeding, more than", introduced by jan inwin
* **jasima** ─ "reflect, mirror, opposite end", introduced by jan inwin, jan Maliku, jan Kisinja and jan Wesu
* **lanpan** — a nicer alternative to 'kama jo' or 'alasa', introduced by jan inwin, jan Maliku and jan Wesu
* **linluwi** ─ "internet, network", introduced by jan inwin
* **lisa** ─ "squeeze, restrict, narrow", introduced by me (← Icelandic þrýsta)
* **suta** ─ "authority, control, domination", introduced by me (← Arabic سُلْطَة sulṭa)
* **waleja** ─ "context, relevant", introduced by jan inwin

## alternatives to musi
myself and jan inwin frequently begrudge the lack of nuance in the toki pona word musi which traditionally means "fun, art, play". this range of concepts is incredibly important to us both so we collaborated on a new set of words to express them more sincerely.

* **musi** ─ fun, laugh, joke (← Esperanto amuzi)
* **nole** ─ music, sing, melody (← Korean 노래 norae)
* **oselo** ─ theatre, pretend (← Othello)
* **otan** ─ art, poetry (← Old Saxon Wôdan)

## grammar & style
i enjoy writing toki pona in a fairly loose and minimalist manner. some key points of my style:

* less reliance on **pi** for bracketing in modifier chains
* use of **o** to mark optative mood (syntactically identical to **li**, except not ungrammatical with **mi** or **sina**)
* use of <a href="/time">tenpo ko</a> for talking about absolute time
