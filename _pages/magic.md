i picked out the below track - <span class="subtle">lover // over the moon ─ alice phoebe lou</span> - as a good accompaniment to this page.

## introduction 🌬️
how can i begin to understand the precise mechanisms by which i find myself with thought, with feeling, with life? whether it's inherent of my matter, whether it was breathed into me, the conclusion is the same. i am custodian of something far greater than the mere sum of its parts.

## nature 🌿
i was born of this world, every cell a recycling of countless prior experiences. who am i to act as arbiter of where any external experience stops and begins when i can make little comprehension as to the nature of my own?

every facet of nature in her grandure - every tree, every drop of water, each and every creature and flowering blossom - is imbued with the same force within which i find my own origin. eorþe, our mother, breathed life into me as she did all things and so in kinship i approach the world.

## practice 🕯️
communication far exceeds the strictures of that which is formalised in human discourse. we speak with the body, with the mind. and we are heard.

i find great joy in conversation with nature, aided by her provisions - myriad herbs, wihta, ése and charms. clear intention begets a clarity of mind.

## heavens 🌙
countless are those above, shifting and celestial in their very own nature, their grip dancing upon our world.
luna, our moon, ever morphing, whose delicate tug inspires shadowed reflection as much as brightly lit revelation.

## wisdom 🧵
in gentle whispers to an open ear, woden's wind-carried murmurs of the coming threads to be woven into ones wyrd may be heard.

by gift of his runes, these whispers grow louder, as a magnifying glass to a beam of light.

gǽð á wyrd swá hío sceal ─ none can change those threads they are given but to each too is given the might to weave these in their own way.
