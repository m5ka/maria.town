**díuinin** is the [mazadmáh]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah.md %}) practice of taboo gender non-compliance in which a person with a masculine body by birth takes on a feminine social role and appearance, often through assistance of [duním]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah/dunim.md %}), a regional herb drunk as a tea for its feminizing properties.

a person who performs díu̯inin by taking on that gender role is known as a **díuinis** (collective **ihdíuinis**) and can be described through the verb **díuin** “she feminizes herself, is a díuinis”. 

## etymology
all of these terms derive from the mazadmáh root *d·u·n* which originally described only breasts or the process of breastfeeding but had many derivatives generalizing the root to instead describe femininity or womanhood in mazadmáh society.
