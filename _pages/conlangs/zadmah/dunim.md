**dun√≠m** is a bitter-tasting herb regional to the [mazadm√°h]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah.md %}) people which has feminising properties.

## etymology
the word dun√≠m derives from the root _d¬∑u¬∑n_, associated with breasts/breastfeeding or womanhood in general in mazadm√°h society. the _-√≠m_ derivation gives the word the overall meaning of "feminine substance" or "feminine essence".

## typical consumption
dun√≠m is typically drunk as a tea by steeping the dun√≠m leaf in hot water for some minutes, then picking the leaf out and flavouring with lemon or other fruit.

## taboo
owing to its heavy association with [ihd√≠uinis]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah/diuinin.md %}) as a social class, dun√≠m is considered in√≥…£u (heavily taboo).

## composition
dun√≠m contains relatively low but not insignificant levels of estrogen in the form of two different estradiol esters, as well as varying amounts of progesterone depending on the exact strain and growth conditions of the herb.

aside from the elements associated with feminisation, dun√≠m also contains very small amounts of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, making it very slightly sympathomimetic.
