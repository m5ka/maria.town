**in칩톢u** is an adjective used in [mazadm치h]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah.md %}) culture to describe a person or act deemed socially taboo.

the status of taboo is often associated with [코i콘치h]({% link _pages/conlangs/zadmah/aksom.md %}) social classes and may be part of the mechanism by which people born of non-코i콘치h classes become 코i콘치h.
