namelang is a naming conlang i made in mid-2022 to give my world of warcraft characters names with meaning. ironically for a naming language, it doesn't have a name of its own. poor thing.

i haven't fleshed grammar out super well because of it mostly being for naming, but there is some and i have some examples.

>niví tirna arójol sabrelu, vanatharal.<br>
>if our queen writes a rule, then we shall follow.

>tilis illurta buja crassí atul.<br>
>the healing herbs of elf hills are the most powerful.

>jun inganibur busa slarsí apsinacambur atu.<br>
>blueberry cake is tastier than strawberry cake.
