**zadmáh** ("our language") is a small, a priori conlang of mine spoken by the fictitious **mazadmáh** ("speaking our language") people.

## culture
mazadmáh culture is defined by a great respect for and reliance on the natural world, shaped by a tight-knit but ultimately hierarchical society with a strict relationship to the concept of taboo.

## language
zadmáh words are derived via an expressive system of tri-consonantal roots and patterns. for example, the root z·r·k has a base meaning of "pain" or "hurt". From that we can derive words such as **zírrkuz** ("pain-relief herb"), **ázrik** ("she hurts, causes pain"), **zórak** ("she is in pain") and **zarkón** ("problem, issue").
