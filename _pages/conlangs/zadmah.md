**zadm치h** ("our language") is a small, a priori conlang of mine spoken by the fictitious **mazadm치h** ("speaking our language") people.

mazadm치h culture is defined by a great respect for and reliance on the natural world, shaped by a tight-knit but ultimately hierarchical society.

## culture
the most stark division in mazadm치h society is one of class, with the **코i콘치h** (literally "those outside") unable to participate in government or military and often excluded from certain social events.

there are many subdivisions within the 코i콘치h, such as the **d칤uinis** who derive their name from **d칤uinin**, the practice of taboo gender non-compliance in mazadm치h culture. most d칤uinis (literally "those who feminise") are raised masculine and of another class from birth but take on a feminine appearance and social role later on, thereby moving them into this class.

the d칤uinis are strongly associated with gabl치h, a form of ritual magic, and with dun칤m, a regional bitter herb drunk as tea for its feminising properties.

taboo, often described with the term **in칩톢u** ("bitter"), is a very important aspect of mazadm치h culture, dictating a lot of what is acceptable within society.

## language
zadm치h words are derived via an expressive system of tri-consonantal roots and patterns. for example, the root z췅r췅k has a base meaning of "pain" or "hurt". From that we can derive words such as **z칤rrkuz** ("pain-relief herb"), **치zrik** ("she hurts, causes pain"), **z칩rak** ("she is in pain") and **zark칩n** ("problem, issue").
