caliprian is an [indo-european](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) language i started working on in april 2022

it's spoken in calipria, a fictitious collection of islands in the mediterranean.

here's a poem i wrote in caliprian:

> ath캶패am mini fist칩m in vestrei t拷듭<br>
> ak攷늝ois an칰 kh칰ptim 치ist콄r im칩i<br>
> fir칩m kis kar칤 v치urom t拷듨 hoi k칠riet<br>
> s콞패r캶 ag치rsket

and the translation:

> if only i could put the knowledge into your hand<br>
> that you could drink it, the desire felt by me<br>
> a poison that travels such through your blood<br>
> that your skin is aflame.
