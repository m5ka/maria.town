**riyan** is the language spoken in riyana, a country located in the entirely fictitious planet akinien.

the whole planet, and especially the continent on which riyana sits, is a collaborative project between myself and two friends of mine (also conlangers!)

all our languages are related, going back to the ancient proto-laenkean language spoken around 7,000 years ago.
