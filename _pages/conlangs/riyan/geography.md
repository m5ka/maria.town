← 👈[back to riyan]({% link _pages/conlangs/riyan.md %})

riyana is pretty far north in the continent quisquia (**hyspiŗ** in riyan) and therefore has quite a cold climate, perhaps comparable to that of finland.

there is quite a lot of bog and marshland in southern coastal riyana, which plays a large part in local folklore.

the country radestria, from which riyana only gained true independence a few years ago in 2019, borders riyana to the south.
