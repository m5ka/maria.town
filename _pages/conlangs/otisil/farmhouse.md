you make your way into a small farmhouse. the walls are made up of many large stones piled into thick walls and the low roof is thatched.

inside, a small fire marks the centre of the house, with wooden and bamboo shelves lining the perimeter. one side of the house's interior, however, contains a small mat on the floor laid with straw and leaves for sleeping.

the house is being gently filled with a sweet-smelling smoke rising from a pile of herbs laid over a shallow clay lattice that hangs over the fire. two women in the house tell you the herbs are **za√≠** and the smoke fills you with a pleasant relaxed feeling.

on the shelves by the walls of the farmhouse, you see a whole collection of lidded jugs, all marked by scratches on the widest part of their form. the women tell you they are **zwo√≠h√°√≠** ("fermenting pots"), each anywhere between a few days and a few weeks old.

looking to the ceiling, you see small yellow-brown bricks hanging from a bamboo beam, tied on with small reeds that surround it like a parcel. the women tell you these are **kw√≥imar**, made from **mar** ("soybeans"), and that in a few weeks they will go into zwo√≠h√°√≠ pots too to make **zwo√≠mar**, a fermented soybean paste, later in the year.

the friendliness and cosiness of the farmhouse fills you with comfort, as does the relaxing smoke of the za√≠ and the subtle aroma of vegetable brine and aromatic leaves and vegetables which are piled up in one corner of the room.
