you look into a small fenced area directly adjacent to the little stone-and-thatch farmhouse. you see a collection of **gwáigwai** ("hens") roaming. one of the women from the farmhouse notices your curiosity and tells you that they are **déígwai** ("egg-laying hens") whose **déí** ("eggs") are a very common everyday food in the village.
