like many other people who spend a lot of time online, i have friends beyond the stricture of proximity. this makes timezones and trying to remember everyone's individual utc offset a bit of a pain.

that's why a few years ago i devised this system of time with my friend [joop](https://joop.kiefte.nom.br/).

it's based on splitting the day into four elements:
* 🔥 fire <span class="subtle">(00-06 utc)</span>
* ☁️ air <span class="subtle">(06-12 utc)</span>
* 💧 water <span class="subtle">(12-18 utc)</span>
* 🌱 earth <span class="subtle">(18-24 utc)</span>

this way, the time can be told as the same for every person. for example, as i'm typing this the time is 4 hours 21 minutes into water, or mid-water, for everyone in the world. nice and easy.

all i have to remember is that, for me, i'll tend to be asleep during fire and working from mid-air through to late water.

there's a clock for this system up at [hora.net.br](https://hora.net.br) (thanks joop) and dozens has written about it too, with a cute circle clock to boot which you can find [here](http://tilde.town/~dozens/tenpoko/).

## toki pona
this method is particularly useful for [toki pona]({% link _pages/toki-pona.md %}) which already has limited vocabulary for talking about time in more absolute terms.

in toki pona, i call the system **tenpo ko** ("elemental time") and the time blocks are 🔥 **tenpo seli**, ☁️ **tenpo kon**, 💧 **tenpo telo** and 🌱 **tenpo ma**.

these can also be specified further with the modifiers **open**, **insa** and **pini** for beginning, middle and end respectively.

for the time i gave above (4h 21m into water) i could therefore say:

> tenpo li telo insa

another longer toki pona example using tenpo ko:

> tenpo seli pini la mi moku e kili mute·<br>
> tenpo kon la mi o lanpan e kili sin
