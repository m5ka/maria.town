i learned python at quite a young age and then stopped using it as my main language a few years later in favour of ruby, js or c# (for web things) and c or go (for non-web things).

since last year though i picked python back up to use with django and i've been using it as one of my main tools for web development ever since as it's so easy to get a quick prototype of something up and running.

## django/python tools i use
* [jinja2](https://niwi.nz/django-jinja/latest/) for templates
* [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for opinionated code formatting
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) for python global and virtual environment management
* [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) for serving django

special shout-out too to django rest framework and django-filter which are handy when i want to spin  up a quick api with django, though for apis i usually prefer using go altogether.
