my site is inspired by the web that once was. where personal sites and the free expression they brought with them were the norm. the internet was one big canvas.

now, most content is concentrated within the walls of social media behemoths with all the issues that come along with those. the web, once open, is firmly strangled in capitalism's blood-stained grip.

returning to this older form of expression is my way of reclaiming the beauty of the interconnected web.
