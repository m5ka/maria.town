here's my site's old 88x31! feel free to use it on your site if you'd like. i'm meaning to make a new one but it'll be a little bit before i have the energy to.

![marzka.cafe badge]({% link /assets/images/88x31/marzka_cafe_88x31.png %}){:width="88" height="31"}

just right click it, click "save image as..." to save it somewhere and then upload it to your site. you can present it as a link to my site here like this:

```html
<a href="https://maria.town">
    <img src="marzka_cafe_88x31.png" width="88" height="31" alt="marzka.cafe badge">
</a>
```
