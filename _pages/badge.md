here's my site's 88x31! feel free to use it on your site if you'd like.

![maria.town badge]({% link /assets/images/88x31/maria_town_88x31.png %}){:width="88" height="31"}

just right click it, click "save image as..." to save it somewhere and then upload it to your site. you can present it as a link to my site here like this:

```html
<a href="https://maria.town">
    <img src="maria_town_88x31.png" width="88" height="31" alt="maria.town badge">
</a>
```

i used to have a different badge too, from when the site was at **marzka.cafe**:

![old marzka.cafe badge]({% link /assets/images/88x31/marzka_cafe_88x31.png %}){:width="88" height="31"}
