**marzka** is pronounced <span class="subtle">/ˈmaʂka/</span> ([ipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)) ─ that's like "mashka" if ipa is nonsense to you.

it's a diminutive (basically, cute) form of my proper name which is itself, for me at least, derived from **marzanna**, a polish deity.

marzanna is associated with death and rebirth, especially the cyclical rebirth of winter into spring. she's also associated with dreams.
