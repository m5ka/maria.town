programming has always been a massive part of my life, from writing windows batch scripts at age 8 right up to now where web and software development is my career.

you can find a lot of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/marzusia){:rel="me"}.

## my favourite tools, frameworks & languages
* go
* [django]({% link _pages/programming/django.md %})
* nextjs
* zsh
* mariadb or postgresql (im so bad at deciding)
