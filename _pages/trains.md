in typical gay neurodivergent fashion, i have to say trains are pretty rad.

i definitely don't know nearly as much about them as some people do but there are a few classes of train which stick in my brain as being memorable, whether for good or bad reasons.

## class 390 pendolino
probably one of the first trains i was familiar with when i was young was the [class 390 pendolino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_390), an electric class which virgin trains operated at the time on the [west coast main line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Main_Line). we used to drive to [milton keynes central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes_Central_railway_station) and get the train from there to [wolverhampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_railway_station) to see my grandparents.

i later moved to the north west for university and so became familiar with the west coast main line again, this time from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_railway_station" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lancaster station</a>.

## class 700 desiro city
a line i made frequent use of as a teenager was the [thameslink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thameslink) line as it was a direct line to get from my hometown to london and beyond.

the trains in use on the line were [class 700 desiro city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_700) which to this day are a possible number one favourite of mine.

my favourite stations (and frequent destinations for the day) were [london blackfriars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfriars_station) and [brighton station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_railway_station).

## class 144 pacer
the [class 144 pacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_144) was a very ugly and noisy diesel class that ran on a few [northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arriva_Rail_North) services whilst i was living in the north-west.

at the time i would frequently visit leeds or other towns in yorkshire via the [morecambe-leeds line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds%E2%80%93Morecambe_line). most often, this would be on a [class 150 sprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_150) but on a lucky (or unlucky?) day you'd get a pacer.

to this day, i don't think there's any journey more beautiful than going the full length of the morecambe-leeds line at sunrise or sunset and looking out the window the whole time.
