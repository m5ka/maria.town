![Deploy to Neocities status](https://github.com/marzusia/marzka.cafe/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)

This is the repo where I store my personal website. It's a static site generated by Jekyll using a custom layout/theme I hand-wrote myself (find it in the `_layouts` folder).

I wanted to retain the essence of the hand-written web but with the ease of writing in Markdown and having automagic deployment.

## Layout
* `_pages` and `_posts` are the content of the site, almost all in Markdown
* `_plugins` are any custom plugins I've written to extend Jekyll's default functionality
* `_sass` are my SASS include-able files, which makes up most of the stylesheets for my site
* `assets` are any other static bits to be included such as images. It also includes coffeescript and SASS which is converted to JS and CSS on generation.

## Deploying
I deploy the site to Neocities via the very useful [jekyll build action](https://github.com/jerryjvl/jekyll-build-action) and [deploy to neocities](https://github.com/jonchang/deploy-neocities) Github actions.

You can find it online at [marzka.cafe](https://marzka.cafe) or on its [Neocities page](https://neocities.org/site/marzka).

## FAQ
### Can I use your design/layout?
Sure! I'd appreciate a link though if you feel like it.

### How did you do this? I want to for my smallnet site!
I'll probably write a tutorial on Jekyll and Neocities for beginners at some point in the future so stay tuned for that.
